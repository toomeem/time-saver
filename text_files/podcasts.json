I explain the neurobiology of learning and neuroplasticity and how correctly timed, self-directed test-taking can be leveraged to improve learning and prevent forgetting.\u00a0 I discuss the study habits of the most successful learners, ways to limit distractions, how to set study goals, and how tests can be used as tools to learn, not just as a means for evaluating one\u2019s mastery of learned material. A surprising aspect of tests, specifically self-testing soon after exposure to new material, is that they can significantly improve your ability to learn, apply, and maintain new knowledge. I also discuss tools to improve focus and alertness while studying. By the end of this episode, you will have learned various science-supported actionable tools you can use to better learn, remember, and apply new information.

We discuss how the brain controls our sense of hunger, satiety, and thirst. He explains how dopamine levels impact our cravings and eating behavior (amount, food choices, etc) and how we develop and can change our food preferences and adjust how much we need to eat to feel satisfied. We discuss factors that have led to the recent rise in obesity, such as interactions between our genes and the environment and the role of processed foods and food combinations. We also discuss the new class of medications developed for the treatment of obesity and diabetes, including the GLP-1 agonists semaglutide (Ozempic, Wegovy) and tirzepatide (Mounjaro). We discuss how these medications work to promote weight loss, the source of their side effects, and the newer compounds soon to overcome some of those side effects, such as muscle loss.

We discuss how the brain controls our sense of hunger, satiety, and thirst. He explains how dopamine levels impact our cravings and eating behavior (amount, food choices, etc) and how we develop and can change our food preferences and adjust how much we need to eat to feel satisfied.</p><p>We discuss factors that have led to the recent rise in obesity, such as interactions between our genes and the environment and the role of processed foods and food combinations. We also discuss the new class of medications developed for the treatment of obesity and diabetes, including the GLP-1 agonists semaglutide (Ozempic, Wegovy) and tirzepatide (Mounjaro). We discuss how these medications work to promote weight loss, the source of their side effects, and the newer compounds soon to overcome some of those side effects, such as muscle loss.</p><p>Dr. Knight provides an exceptionally clear explanation for our sense of hunger, thirst, and food cravings that translates to practical knowledge to help listeners better understand their relationship to food, food choices, and meal size to improve their diet and overall health.</p><p>For show notes, including referenced articles and additional resources, please visit <a href=\"https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-zachary-knight-the-science-of-hunger-medications-to-combat-obesity\" rel=\"nofollow\">hubermanlab.com</a>.</p><h2>Thank you to our sponsors</h2><p>AG1: <a href=\"https://drinkag1.com/partner/huberman/ctr?utm_source&#61;podcast&amp;utm_medium&#61;partnerships&amp;utm_campaign&#61;drhuberman_d35ct__a1294__o56&amp;utm_term&#61;variable__a1294__o56&amp;utm_content&#61;7-Health-Wellness__a1294__o56\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://drinkag1.com/huberman</a>\u00a0</p><p>BetterHelp: <a href=\"https://betterhelp.com/huberman\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://betterhelp.com/huberman</a></p><p>Eight Sleep: <a href=\"https://eightsleep.com/huberman\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://eightsleep.com/huberman</a></p><p>Waking Up: <a href=\"https://wakingup.com/huberman\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://wakingup.com/huberman</a></p><p>LMNT: <a href=\"https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://drinklmnt.com/huberman</a></p><h2>Timestamps</h2><p>00:00:00 Dr. Zachary Knight</p><p>00:02:38 Sponsors: BetterHelp, Helix Sleep &amp; Waking Up</p><p>00:07:07 Hunger &amp; Timescales</p><p>00:11:28 Body Fat, Leptin, Hunger</p><p>00:17:51 Leptin Resistance &amp; Obesity</p><p>00:20:52 Hunger, Food Foraging &amp; Feeding Behaviors, AgRP Neurons</p><p>00:30:26 Sponsor: AG1</p><p>00:32:15 Body Weight &amp; Obesity, Genes &amp; POMC Neurons</p><p>00:39:54 Obesity, Genetics &amp; Environmental Factors</p><p>00:46:05 Whole Foods, Ultra-Processed Foods &amp; Palatability</p><p>00:49:32 Increasing Whole Food Consumption, Sensory Specific Satiety &amp; Learning</p><p>00:58:55 Calories vs. Macronutrients, Protein &amp; Salt</p><p>01:02:23 Sponsor: LMNT</p><p>01:03:58 Challenges of Weight Loss: Hunger &amp; Energy Expenditure</p><p>01:09:50 GLP-1 Drug Development, Semaglutide, Ozempic, Wegovy</p><p>01:19:03 GLP-1 Drugs: Muscle Loss, Appetite Reduction, Nausea</p><p>01:23:24 Pharmacologic &amp; Physiologic Effects; GLP-1 Drugs, Additional Positive Effects</p><p>01:30:14 GLP-1-Plus Development, Tirzepatide, Mounjaro, AMG 133</p><p>01:34:49 Alpha-MSH &amp; Pharmacology</p><p>01:40:41 Dopamine, Eating &amp; Context</p><p>01:46:01 Dopamine &amp; Learning, Water Content &amp; Food</p><p>01:53:23 Salt, Water &amp; Thirst</p><p>02:03:27 Hunger vs. Thirst</p><p>02:05:46 Dieting, Nutrition &amp; Mindset</p><p>02:09:39 Tools: Improving Diet &amp; Limiting Food Intake</p><p>02:14:15 Anti-Obesity Drug Development</p><p>02:17:03 Zero-Cost Support, Spotify &amp; Apple Follow &amp; Reviews, YouTube Feedback, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter</p><p><a href=\"https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer\" rel=\"nofollow\">Disclaimer</a></p>", "id": "36QmF30Of7TCPQfRey6K16", "is_externally_hosted": false, "is_playable": true, "language": "en", "languages": ["en"], "name": "Dr. Zachary Knight: The Science of Hunger & Medications to Combat Obesity", "release_date": "2024-06-17", "release_date_precision": "day", "show": {"description": "Huberman Lab discusses neuroscience \u2014 how our brain and its connections with the organs of our body control our perceptions, our behaviors, and our health.

We also discuss existing and emerging tools for measuring and changing how our nervous system works. Andrew Huberman, Ph.D., is a neuroscientist and tenured professor in the department of neurobiology, and by courtesy, psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford School of Medicine. He has made numerous significant contributions to the fields of brain development, brain function and neural plasticity, which is the ability of our nervous system to rewire and learn new behaviors, skills and cognitive functioning.\u00a0 Huberman\u00a0is a McKnight Foundation and Pew Foundation Fellow and was awarded the Cogan Award, given to the scientist making the most significant discoveries in the study of vision, in 2017. His lab\u2019s most recent work focuses on the influence of vision and respiration on human performance and brain states such as fear and courage. He also works on neural regeneration and directs a clinical trial to promote visual restoration in diseases that cause blindness.\u00a0Huberman is also actively involved in developing tools now in use by the elite military in the U.S. and Canada, athletes, and technology industries to optimize performance in high stress environments, enhance neural plasticity, mitigate stress and optimize sleep.\u00a0\u00a0 Work from the\u00a0Huberman\u00a0Laboratory at Stanford School of Medicine has been published in top journals including Nature, Science and Cell and has been featured in TIME, BBC, Scientific American, Discover and other top media outlets.\u00a0 In 2021, Dr. Huberman launched the Huberman Lab podcast.

We also discuss existing and emerging tools for measuring and changing how our nervous system works. Andrew Huberman, Ph.D., is a neuroscientist and tenured professor in the department of neurobiology, and by courtesy, psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford School of Medicine. He has made numerous significant contributions to the fields of brain development, brain function and neural plasticity, which is the ability of our nervous system to rewire and learn new behaviors, skills and cognitive functioning.\u00a0 Huberman\u00a0is a McKnight Foundation and Pew Foundation Fellow and was awarded the Cogan Award, given to the scientist making the most significant discoveries in the study of vision, in 2017. His lab\u2019s most recent work focuses on the influence of vision and respiration on human performance and brain states such as fear and courage. He also works on neural regeneration and directs a clinical trial to promote visual restoration in diseases that cause blindness.\u00a0Huberman is also actively involved in developing tools now in use by the elite military in the U.S. and Canada, athletes, and technology industries to optimize performance in high stress environments, enhance neural plasticity, mitigate stress and optimize sleep.\u00a0\u00a0 Work from the\u00a0Huberman\u00a0Laboratory at Stanford School of Medicine has been published in top journals including Nature, Science and Cell and has been featured in TIME, BBC, Scientific American, Discover and other top media outlets.\u00a0 In 2021, Dr. Huberman launched the Huberman Lab podcast.

We also discuss existing and emerging tools for measuring and changing how our nervous system works. Andrew Huberman, Ph.D., is a neuroscientist and tenured professor in the department of neurobiology, and by courtesy, psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford School of Medicine. He has made numerous significant contributions to the fields of brain development, brain function and neural plasticity, which is the ability of our nervous system to rewire and learn new behaviors, skills and cognitive functioning.\u00a0 Huberman\u00a0is a McKnight Foundation and Pew Foundation Fellow and was awarded the Cogan Award, given to the scientist making the most significant discoveries in the study of vision, in 2017. His lab\u2019s most recent work focuses on the influence of vision and respiration on human performance and brain states such as fear and courage. He also works on neural regeneration and directs a clinical trial to promote visual restoration in diseases that cause blindness.\u00a0Huberman is also actively involved in developing tools now in use by the elite military in the U.S. and Canada, athletes, and technology industries to optimize performance in high stress environments, enhance neural plasticity, mitigate stress and optimize sleep.\u00a0\u00a0 Work from the\u00a0Huberman\u00a0Laboratory at Stanford School of Medicine has been published in top journals including Nature, Science and Cell and has been featured in TIME, BBC, Scientific American, Discover and other top media outlets.\u00a0 In 2021, Dr. Huberman launched the Huberman Lab podcast.

We discuss specific supplements and compounds that peer-reviewed studies illustrate can adjust testosterone and estrogen levels by changing their binding to other proteins, raising them directly, or changing other hormones released from the brain and pituitary.

what did you feel exactly? What had, how did you know you were having one? Cause didn\u2019t it happen? You say it happened in the middle of the night. Oh, I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s kind of nonspecific, you know, just, you know, you kind of cough to, there\u2019s a reflex that tries to lower your chance of, you know, put your heart back in rhythm. I heard you had jaw pain, arm pain. I\u2019ve had jaw pain, arm pain for years. And I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s musculoskeletal cause of the stupid stuff I did. The heart attack hurt worse than the, uh, than getting shot and while I was in the hospital and I got up about two o \u2018clock. So about three 30 that afternoon, Janet. Hold, hold on. This was in the morning, right? You had this. So what Dr. Lewis is missing the point here of what I\u2019m trying to get him to say, purposely, he decided to come to work the whole day first and just told me he didn\u2019t feel good, but I knew something wasn\u2019t right with him because we have a product in here called liquid capsicum and what it is, it\u2019s for open wounds and we pour it on open wounds to help them heal because it does sear them together. Well, Dr. Lewis started drinking it straight at our house and it\u2019s a vasodilator. And I was like, are you sure you\u2019re supposed to do that? He goes, listen, this makes me feel good. And I thought, this is really weird. So does bourbon, but I didn\u2019t drink it. And I thought he didn\u2019t look right, but of course he had not been, uh, informing me of the stuff that happened the night before. So, you know, I gave him magnesium. We\u2019d always heard that if you opened a capsule of magnesium that and put it in your lip and let it dissolve there, um, that it would stop a heart attack. We were trained that way. We didn\u2019t know if it worked cause we\u2019ve never been around anybody that\u2019s having an actual heart attack, but I was giving them to Dr. Lewis all day long, off and on. And he was drinking this liquid capsicum. And we\u2019re not saying don\u2019t go to the hospital. Don\u2019t have a cardiologist because you didn\u2019t, you need to. Yes. I\u2019m just saying when you\u2019re thinking, Oh, Hey, these supplements don\u2019t work. Yeah, they kind of really did because the story gets really good after this. Um, so anyway, at about three 30, he asked me if I\u2019ll drive him to the emergency room. So we went to the emergency room, the, uh, the doctor there said, put him on some machines and said, are you sure he\u2019s having a heart attack? Cause it\u2019s not really showing. And I said, well he is, I\u2019ve been given a magnesium, so it\u2019s probably slowed it down. He goes, you\u2019ve done what? And I said, magnesium. And he goes, Oh, well then we\u2019re going to need to run a magnesium test because he\u2019s probably overdosed on it. I said, Oh dear Lord. I said, no, he\u2019s not. I said, I\u2019m just trying to save his life. Well, I\u2019m, I\u2019m always trying to be Joe cool and make their life better and their, their boring stress field shift better. I said, no, if you get overdosed magnesium, I\u2019d be pooping in my pants. And, uh, it got worse and worse and worse. And Janet said, aren\u2019t you supposed to give him nitro like in the movies? He said, well, I\u2019ve got procedure. I\u2019ve got to go through and it\u2019s, it\u2019s getting worse and worse and worse. And uh, meanwhile, meanwhile, they, um, finally decide he\u2019s having a heart attack because our magnesium caps comes wore off and, uh, they give him the nitro and morphine. And on that, he still has a 212 over something blood pressure and something 65 or something like that. Something crazy high. And I\u2019m thinking, you know, God told me outside he was going to be fine. So I knew he was that, we\u2019ll just get this done. He\u2019ll, he\u2019ll, he\u2019ll be done. Well, cardiologists came in super nice as we\u2019re going to take you back to surgery. If it all goes well, we\u2019ll go through your wrist. Uh, w you do have a blockage. Um, so he said, we\u2019re going to go and try to put a stent in. And so then they decided that there was a man that had come in ahead of him that was really bad, like near death. He coded. Yeah, he did code. So they took him ahead of Dr. Lewis. So, um, Dr. Lewis had to wait two and a half more hours to get into the surgery room, which made him start having more problems because he says it in a calm tone of voice. If he says it\u2019s a 10, it\u2019s a 10. And I said, have you ever heard this song? Everybody wants to see Jesus, but nobody wants to go now. Right. And so two and a half hours later, anyway, uh, the cardiologist come out and said, you know, we, we saved the other guy. And so they took Dr. Lewis back and they said, we\u2019re on a roll today. Um, he\u2019s going to be fine. He was, Dr. Lewis was back to 35 minutes and they were done with him. They were able to go through the rest. He had one blockage. It was 100 % blocked. He did get a stent and a balloon, which my brother calls party favors. Uh, so, uh, but the rest of the arteries were not blocked at all, but the one that was blocked was to his lung, which was to his brain. So he was not, uh, he wasn\u2019t thinking real clearly for a little while. So, um, yeah, under the second shot of morphine to decrease the pain, I said, well, yeah, no, I\u2019m not going to renew my bowels, even though I\u2019ve never broken them, but yeah, I will.</p><br/><p>00:10:05 \u2013 00:15:01</p><br/><p>So it\u2019s, it might be goofy. So anyway, it all went well. Somehow it got out all over long view. I do not know how that, that he\u2019d had a heart attack while he was having a heart attack, uh, in our small town here. I know how celebrities must feel on some very small text, phone calls and emails before I even got to the 10 out of a 10 in pain. And you know, anyway, so it, but anyway, people all knew about it. And Dr. Lewis really wasn\u2019t sure if he want, what he wanted to say, because, you know, we run a natural health store. And when you\u2019ve gone through something like that, you\u2019ve, you\u2019ve partially feel like, well, you failed. You\u2019re telling all these people to do this stuff and you failed. Well, please note the supplements didn\u2019t fail. I failed to pay attention to it. And the other part is we\u2019re all human and things are going to happen to you. And sometimes it\u2019s just genetic. And sometimes, you know, you\u2019re, you\u2019re slowing things down or not do anything by speeding something up. So you can\u2019t stop everything, but you can slow it down. So for about two weeks there, he was kind of like, you know, I, I don\u2019t really understand. I took all the stuff. Well, then we went back for his checkup with the cardiologist and, um, the cardiologist when he was in the hospital told him absolutely no, no, and no to any kind of supplement he would ever think about taking, uh, because they wanted him on drugs. And, uh, we\u2019re not saying the drugs are bad. We\u2019re just saying the side effects I cannot live with. Yes. We\u2019re, we\u2019re just like, Oh, this is not good. And then they took things away that made him feel better, like fish oil and turmeric and weird things. Um, but when he got in to have his checkup, they did an EKG on him and said, I don\u2019t know what you did, but you have absolutely no scar tissue to your heart and no permanent damage, which we knew God was not done with the story then because the supplements we had given him stopped it. So the whole moral of the story here is, and why we\u2019re on here today is to tell you, don\u2019t ignore your health. Don\u2019t assume just because you are a patient of ours and have been for many years and are buying the better supplements that you don\u2019t need yearly lab, because it is extremely important. At this point, we\u2019re going to be doing ours every six months for a while to make sure everything is, uh, better. And then we\u2019re also, because of the way this is, uh, what happened, we\u2019ve decided to put our labs on sale and we have made a couple of cardiac panels because of Dr. Lewis. I can thank him for that. Um, but we\u2019re given 10 % off the labs and, and some of you guys don\u2019t listen right away. So I apologize, but hopefully you\u2019re listening right away because this is only good until, um, no, the end of November, 2023, but it\u2019s 10 % off. If you buy it online, you can put it in the code word health, H E A L T H and get yourself checked. We don\u2019t care which panel you pick, but if you have heart problems in your family or suspect you\u2019re having an issue of some sort, pick the cardiac panel. So Dr. Lewis, how would you like to, uh, what people need to know? What do you wish you\u2019d have done different? What wish you to, what do you wish you\u2019d have known? What do you wish you to take in more of? So many times, and again, I never use names because I don\u2019t want everybody in Longview. We had people from Hughes Springs to Houston that knew about this before I was even gone into surgery, which is, you know, uh, I\u2019m glad you care that much, but you know, quieten it down. Anyway, I tell the story about a dear, dear friend of mine that knew she had a high CRP and she ignored it for four years, had a heart attack and she always had money for beer, cigarettes and marijuana, but she never had money for supplements. And she\u2019s had massive problems and died now. Uh, wonderful, wonderful person. And you know, I wasn\u2019t guilty of ignoring it. I was guilty of not looking for it. And, uh, And we thought, you know, cause in Texas this year, uh, it has been extremely hot during the summer. I mean like 106, 110, just unbearable. And we knew he was having trouble, uh, getting air, maybe is a good way to say it. He just looked, uh, fatigued. She said, I looked like a guppy out of water or a carp. I thought maybe this is what getting older looks like. Carps are ugly and she\u2019s calling me a carp. No, no, here, here\u2019s the deal. Uh, there\u2019s a scripture in the Bible. I think it\u2019s out of Proverbs. It says, a wise man foresees danger and takes precautions.</p><br/><p>00:15:01 \u2013 00:20:02</p><br/><p>Well, apparently I wasn\u2019t wise, but a simpleton or a fool ignores this and suffers the consequences. And that\u2019s out of Proverbs. So, you know, look it up. So the toxic environment, you know, I\u2019ve talked about polluted air raises blood pressure. My blood pressure has always been sky high, always tease. When a mosquito bites me, it blows his butt out. Cause it\u2019s, you know, so, uh, the blood pressure is so high, toxic air affects the heart through the olfactory. Nerve norepinephrine raises and dah, dah, dah, dah, dah. Uh, let\u2019s see. And I\u2019m looking through some research and notes that I\u2019ve made. You know, I\u2019ve read thousands of research articles, uh, environment in flames endothelium. Well, guess what? Janet says our Dyson air purifier, which is over where I sit by the, uh, couch. She said, God, they must be dropping chemtrails on us. Well, see Dyson, which I have this humidifier deal every year, it seems like in December it it\u2019s suddenly due. Like it\u2019s says it\u2019s full, you know, you never know if this things are true, but the, the filter is extremely high. And so I think, well, are they just setting me up for buying another filter every year? And that filter has been running in our house since we moved in there, uh, a year and a half, two years ago. And it had been on low, uh, like, like it was like the particulates in the air was low. Yeah. And because it was interrupting the volume on my TV and I thought, what\u2019s wrong with this thing? It just keeps being higher. And then, and then the, the bearings, I guess started squealing in our air conditioner about two months ago, Dr. Lewis said, I think that\u2019s bearings on there going out. Well, I noticed when that started happening, the Dyson air filter went up to critical levels and I thought, well, that\u2019s probably a fluke and it\u2019s getting close to December. You know, we\u2019re, we\u2019re getting a new filter. Um, but ironically we had to have our inside unit replaced on our air conditioner during all this also. But the minute it happened, the Dyson went back down to no noise at all. So we were in Halen Freon. That\u2019s why I talked to you about the environment and toxic air affects the heart through the olfactory nerve. And you know, here\u2019s the other thing, I\u2019m going to get into some specifics here in a minute, but, and I told my cardiologist, which I very, very much like, I was luck luck, lucked out because hand of God always is on me. He was a good guy, but they said, no, no, no. And heck no, don\u2019t take any homeopathics, nothing, no vitamins, no minerals. And I\u2019m like, I told him, I said, I\u2019m gonna submit to authority cause I came in asking for your help. And I said, I appreciate you saving my life. He said, I didn\u2019t save your life. God did, which made me like him even more. But then it talks about, coenzyme Q 10 is an energy field for your heart statins, deplete coenzyme Q 10. Then you\u2019ve got L carnitine. I love, love, love, love our L carnitine. Uh, it\u2019s, it\u2019s, uh, supplementation of L carnitine after a heart attack increases the survival rate and makes it much less likely that you\u2019ll suffer a second heart attack. Magnesium relaxes arterial walls, reduces blood pressure, makes it easier for the heart to pump blood nice and will lower your triglycerides and the bad kind of the LDLs and most specific, the VLDLs, omega threes. They said, no, no, no. Hey, oh no, don\u2019t take a maga threes. And it\u2019s like, well, we got the good fish oil is three times more absorbable. And uh, and you\u2019ve gone back to adding to it. I know the bottle says one, but if you\u2019re a cardiac risk, you really are to consider doing two of them. Show me the research says one\u2019s good. So dr. Lewis takes two. Okay. There\u2019s a reason for that. And we\u2019ve added because since dr. Lewis\u2019s incident, uh, we\u2019ve added back in our CoQ 10, 300 milligram. And I can tell a difference when I take it. That\u2019s a huge thing for people with heart issues at all or heart problems. And you got NATO kinase, which is a clot buster, other supplements, and I\u2019m taking them all now is vitamin C, curcumin, resveratrol, uh, and different flavanols, flavonoids and polyphenols, uh, which would be Cuse and bromelain. Uh, so that that\u2019s the general. And, and this is, this is out of a book, you know, research. One of the best things you can do is called nitric oxide revive. And it\u2019s like, there\u2019s other reasons you should take it, but it\u2019s a time release to l -arginine doesn\u2019t work on women though, just on men. Right. I mean, for other reasons, you should take it. It does work on heart stuff for women. It decreases the inflammation of the endotheliums, which means less likely to clot. And then you get a better blood flow to areas. Nitric oxide is what makes Viagra work.</p><br/><p>00:20:02 \u2013 00:25:01</p><br/><p>You\u2019ve heard me say that. Does it work on women? Sometimes when you get other things engorged, it makes things a lot better. So nitric oxide revive has massive cardiovascular circulatory benefits, but it also helps detoxify ammonia, uh, hormone secretion and immune health. Okay. This is a good one and it\u2019s been real popular amongst the people taking it. A coenzyme Q 10 is really, really good. Uh, it plays a major role in energy production, which is ATP. There is one thing we want to say about dr. Lewis is heart attack because I know half of you out there are wondering and we would wonder ourselves. So we\u2019re just going to put it to bed. Did he do a jibby jab? No, he did not. It was not any jibby jab related. They asked me in the hospital, did you get this vaccination? I said, oh, hell no. Uh, I, I, a bourbon shot and they said, you take shingle shot. I said, oh hell no. Bourbon shot. Did you get your flu shot? I said, bourbon shot. Now here\u2019s the thing. Also, you know, I\u2019m trying to be a little bit rough and tough because if I don\u2019t, I\u2019ll cry. He is sensitive to after this. So sometimes I have to talk for him. Yeah. The lady at the hospital, I talked about the major HIPAA noncompliance there. She called me later and she said, uh, how are you doing? Are you having, and it\u2019s real common to have depression after heart attacks and other things. I said, well, I came to you mad as a wet hand, and now I\u2019m crying like a woman at a lifetime movie. So I said, I\u2019m doing fine. Just forget about the HIPAA noncompliance. And I said, you saved my life. Good God, I\u2019m happy. Uh, there\u2019s another thing in Proverbs that says above all else, guard your heart for everything you do flows from it. Keep your mouth free of perversity. So I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t some days, but you know, you kind of have to, to get over the crying like a woman at a lifetime movie. But the other thing we wanted to mention also, you know, we told you we\u2019re sort of told you we\u2019re going to get more into another podcast about this when we have, uh, the actual steps to do it. But we\u2019re, uh, now because we\u2019re partnered with a triple board certified, uh, MD, uh, she\u2019s also, uh, uh, board of pain medicine and she\u2019s also certified in the Academy of cosmetic surgery. So she\u2019s, um, got lots of certifications. And she\u2019s really easy to talk to. She will put your spirit at peace. Now this only includes five States where she\u2019s licensed. Yeah. We\u2019re going to offer integrated medical and nutrition services in horse, Texas, Florida, Pennsylvania, New York, and West Virginia. Uh, people that are doing the nutrition and the supplements that we put them on, um, will also be offered if Dr. Lewis sees fit for you, the ability to talk to her about semi -glutide shots, uh, the compounding pharmacies will send it directly in the mail to you because it turns out that semi -glutide shots can actually help reduce your rate of heart attack by up to 20 % and also kidney problems up to 20%. And again, as I\u2019ve said a million times, it depends on what research you read because there\u2019s plenty of research that says, well, if you do this, you decrease your chance of heart attack 50 to 75%, you know, like just taking a good vitamin E most of it\u2019s not, but yeah, there, there\u2019s so many things. And I want you to understand that, you know, this may be a hodgepodge of information. I\u2019m sorry about, you know, getting weepy on you, but you know, the, the fact that you started with us in the first place means that there are hope in your heart that you can change or we can help you change. This is true in our experience, even when the family members are not aware of it, but it helps if you have the family support. So your presence here is a reflection of your hope and believe at some level that you\u2019re capable of change. And I told the guys and I don\u2019t mind dying. I don\u2019t mind seeing Jesus, but today\u2019s not a good day. Cause frankly, I could have checked out. My spirit was right there. And I said, you know, the last 24, 25 years with Janet\u2019s been kind of a lot of fun and I think I\u2019m good for another 25 years. And that\u2019s the reason I chose to live. It was that close and you know, yeah, now I\u2019m fine. I\u2019m fine. Yeah. Y \u2018all quit worrying about me. My friends are still calling and texting. I said, but it hurt way, way worse than getting shot. It kind of surprised me.</p><br/><p>00:25:02 \u2013 00:30:01</p><br/><p>But uh, you know, two days later I was back in the office. Yeah. People would go, I won\u2019t tell anybody, Dr. Lewis. And I thought, you know, you know, BS stands for bacon sandwich and belief systems. There was a, there was a game we used to play when we were kid called rumors or I think it was rumors or something where you told something and by the time it got back to somebody else, Oh my God, you know, they, they might as well been on fire. Uh, so we thought we\u2019d just come on here and tell, let him tell you it himself. You know, he is fine, but I believe in my heart without a doubt that he went through this experience because it came into play right at the time we integrated with this medical doctor. And you know, she\u2019s easy to talk to y \u2018all, y \u2018all people that will qualify to see her. You\u2019ll love her. But Dr. Lewis, because of the way he lost his dad under medical care or his perception of it because he was a young kid, has never been a great fan of it. And there is a time and a place for all of it, not just part of it. You know that they need to save your life. You need to be down there. You don\u2019t need to wait. And we\u2019ve seen several people decide to wait. And it\u2019s, that\u2019s not a great outcome. So the whole, I think, I think maybe Dr. Lewis\u2019s journey was about him marrying the medical stuff to the nutrition so that you guys get a better outcome. And I know he didn\u2019t think he was going to live, but God told me when it happened, he would. So. I didn\u2019t say that. I said I had a choice. Oh yeah, he did have a choice, but I knew his choice he was going to make before he chose. Janet\u2019s always known more about my opinion than I know. Y \u2018all know that. So, you know, I\u2019m sorry, this, this podcast didn\u2019t turn out exactly the way we wanted. We had all kinds of signs and symptoms and a lot of other research, but, uh, who knows? Was it the Freon? Was it this? Was it that? Was it because I was eating too much candy because during the stress, you know, my drug of choice is sugar. Caffeine is number one. Alcohol is a distant third, but I\u2019ve cut the sugar out and most of the alcohol. So eight days after the heart attack, I said, Hey baby, can I, do you think it\u2019d be okay if I had a drink? She said, well, you\u2019re eight days older than you would have been. So yeah, go ahead and celebrate. But I I\u2019ve never drank much far as volume never, but you know, folks, it, it is, it is so much, we saw a bill that\u2019s not mine yet, but this lady had a bill for a stamp, $158 ,000. Do you know what 20 % of that is? It\u2019s a almost $32 ,000. You can buy a whole lot of supplements from years and years and years and years and years for that. So folks, let\u2019s make a wise choice so that while we\u2019re here, we can be as healthy as we should be as healthy as we can be. Uh, you know, trouble is in East Texas, most, most of us rednecks take better care of our truck than we do the temple of the Holy Spirit. So maybe it\u2019s time we kind of changed our priorities and I\u2019ll be the first to say I should have. Hey, but you know, the supplements did work too. So it wasn\u2019t like, you weren\u2019t doing anything and we kind of knew how to slow it down for a while. So, you know, that magnesium under the lip does really work. Why are the rest of the coronary arteries a hundred percent, uh, clear? The supplements didn\u2019t fail. I failed. And you know, it\u2019s my responsibility and I admit it reluctantly. However, since everybody in their damn dog knows it, I got a text yesterday from Midland, Texas. Well, good God, that\u2019s 500 miles away saying, well, I was told in confidence, it\u2019s like, yeah, that\u2019s 17 steps past. Anyway, here, here\u2019s the thing. Yes, I\u2019ll talk about it now. Yes. I want you to, uh, take good, good care. I love you guys that are very consistent with what you do and thank God there\u2019s a lot of them in the labs have been improved, but maybe we should get a successful. So, you know, I\u2019m going to go ahead to the inspirational part that Janet usually asked me about, and then she can follow up with whatever she wants success in your life or in your health requires people. So choose wisely, whether that\u2019s choosing Janet and me, or whether it\u2019s choosing a spouse that\u2019s supportive, uh, the atmosphere you\u2019re in will create the health that you have or the health that you want. Don\u2019t be careful. Be bold. Don\u2019t be stupid. Like I was, you know, be wise. I missed the wise part. Are you a viewer or a doer? Good question. Your thought life controls the rest of your life, what you think and what you speak. And that\u2019s why I said, keep corrupt talk from your lips. That\u2019s negative talk. And I\u2019m preaching to me. So, you know, y \u2018all be blessed. We will help you in whatever way. Take advantage of the 10 % off. Cause believe it or not, that really is a big deal.</p><br/><p>00:30:01 \u2013 00:32:44</p><br/><p>And, uh, we can do more, uh, to get you healthier, to increase your energy level, uh, make your life happier because you feel better physically. It spills over in your mental and your physical, your spiritual life. And deep down inside, you do know whether or not you feel at your peak or not. I knew I\u2019d wasn\u2019t at my peak and I thought it\u2019ll pass. It\u2019ll pass. It\u2019ll be fine. My, my lab numbers actually looked worse than Dr. Lewis\u2019s and whenever the heart attack happened for him and that machine was going off in the background of his room after his surgery, I called our, one of our practice management, uh, nutritionist and talked to him and he said, you had the heart attack, didn\u2019t you? I said, wasn\u2019t me. It was Dr. Lewis. So, you know, in your gut, you know, you\u2019re not right. So if you\u2019ve not done your lab recently, this is a great opportunity to do that. It\u2019s coming up toward the end of the year. A lot of you guys have health savings account money you have not used. So it\u2019d be a good opportunity to get yourself back in peak condition. And we appreciate you listening to our show. Again, the code word is health, H E A L T H. It\u2019s all lowercase letters per the coupon. It is good until the end of November and it is just on the lab. And, uh, if you\u2019ve not done our lab, go to greenwisdomehealth .com, fill out the health survey. It\u2019ll direct you or should direct you to the correct panel. And if you don\u2019t like that, Dr. Lewis is really good about calling people and talking to them as well. And Dr. Lewis has one final thing to say. You know, you were born to live big, to love to create and to really express the miracle that you are. And I\u2019ve got one thing to say about miracles. Miracles are not contrary to nature, but only contrary to what we know about nature. So take that action and let\u2019s create a miracle. And we\u2019ll be here next time on the Green Wisdom Health Show. Once again, our show has come to an end, but your hope and your health is only beginning. If you or a loved one are in need of a different outcome and are waiting for a step and go to our website and fill out the health survey, please don\u2019t keep us a secret.

We also discuss existing and emerging tools for measuring and changing how our nervous system works. Andrew Huberman, Ph.D., is a neuroscientist and tenured professor in the department of neurobiology, and by courtesy, psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford School of Medicine. He has made numerous significant contributions to the fields of brain development, brain function and neural plasticity, which is the ability of our nervous system to rewire and learn new behaviors, skills and cognitive functioning.\u00a0 Huberman\u00a0is a McKnight Foundation and Pew Foundation Fellow and was awarded the Cogan Award, given to the scientist making the most significant discoveries in the study of vision, in 2017. His lab\u2019s most recent work focuses on the influence of vision and respiration on human performance and brain states such as fear and courage. He also works on neural regeneration and directs a clinical trial to promote visual restoration in diseases that cause blindness.\u00a0Huberman is also actively involved in developing tools now in use by the elite military in the U.S. and Canada, athletes, and technology industries to optimize performance in high stress environments, enhance neural plasticity, mitigate stress and optimize sleep.\u00a0\u00a0 Work from the\u00a0Huberman\u00a0Laboratory at Stanford School of Medicine has been published in top journals including Nature, Science and Cell and has been featured in TIME, BBC, Scientific American, Discover and other top media outlets.\u00a0 In 2021, Dr. Huberman launched the Huberman Lab podcast.

I also dispel common myths about how the cold and flu are transmitted and when you and those around you are contagious. I explain if common preventatives and treatments such as vitamin C, zinc, vitamin D and echinacea work. I also highlight other compounds known to reduce contracting and duration of colds and flu.\u00a0 I discuss how to use exercise and sauna to bolster the immune response. This episode will help listeners understand how to reduce the chances of catching a cold or flu and help people recover more quickly from and prevent the spread of colds and flu.

David explains how he mastered his inner dialogue to build extraordinary levels of discipline and mental and physical toughness. He describes how confronting his early hardships, including physical and mental abuse, learning disorders, and obesity, became a practice of deep and excruciating self-reflection \u2014 eventually allowing him to transmute those experiences into a superhuman work ethic. This conversation is a unique window into David Goggins\u2019 process in that it focuses both on the underlying science and how David manages and directs his inner dialogue. It\u2019s a conversation that will inform and inspire anyone wondering how exactly to go about building discipline and confidence and reach their potential.

We address the \u201ccalories in- calories out\u201d (CICO) model of metabolism and weight regulation and how specific macronutrients (protein, fat, carbohydrates), fiber and sugar can modify the CICO equation. We cover how different types of sugars, specifically fructose, sugars found in liquid form, taste intensity, and other factors impact insulin levels, liver, kidney, and metabolic health. We also explore how fructose in non-fruit sources can be addictive (acting similarly to drugs of abuse) and how sugar alters brain circuits related to food cravings and satisfaction. We discuss the role of sugar in childhood and adult obesity, gut health and disease and mental health. We also discuss how the food industry uses refined sugars to create pseudo foods and what these do to the brain and body. This episode is replete with actionable information about sugar and metabolism, weight control, brain health and body composition. It ought to be of interest to anyone seeking to understand how specific food choices impact the immediate and long-term health of the brain and body.

Transcript of Interview with Simone Rodan Benzaquen, Wayne Sussman, and Dina Siegel Vann: Manya Brachear Pashman: American Jewish Committee has 14 international offices around the world. For today\u2019s episode, we checked in with some of those offices to learn what they're seeing and hearing on the ground since the October 7 Hamas terrorist attack on Israel. Today, we take you to Europe, Africa and Latin America. We start in Paris, where years of work to combat rising antisemitism has seen a serious setback. For more than two decades, since the Second Intifada, antisemitism has been on the rise on the European continent. In fact, it was that ripple effect that prompted AJC to ramp up its advocacy there. AJC Managing Director of Europe Simone Rodan Benzaquen joined us from Paris. Simone Rodan Benzaquen: What we have seen, I think, in Europe is more or less what we've seen, everywhere, what can only be described as an explosion of antisemitism across the European continent, I would say, mostly in Western Europe, here in France in particular, but also in the United Kingdom, we have seen the same. In Germany, we have seen similar things going on in Sweden and Denmark. But of course, here in France, where antisemitism has existed for at least two decades, or at least this contemporary form of antisemitism, for the past two decades with high numbers of antisemitic hate crimes. The situation is very, very serious. We've had basically three times the number of antisemitic hate crimes, since October 7 of what we had during the entire year, last year. \u00a0 We have desecration of cemeteries, we have antisemitic tags. We have intimidation, we have spitting on people. It is as if the sheer horror, the violence that happened on October 7, unleashed an antisemitic passion, an antisemitic violence across the world. As if the horrible images that were filmed by the Hamas terrorists on October 7 sort of was a legitimization. Manya Brachear Pashman: So what does that mean for the Jewish community and daily life? Simone Rodan Benzaquen: We\u2019ve reached a point where people are hiding every single aspect of their Jewish identity. People are changing their names on their delivery apps, people are changing their names on their doorbells, if they believe that they sound Jewish. People are hiding every single aspect of their Jewish identity. On Uber apps, on taxi apps, myself, you know, I go on TV and do interviews quite a bit and so I give a different name to the taxi, and I give a different address a few blocks down the street is to be sure that you know, just in case, the taxi driver doesn't know where I actually live. So everybody takes precautions. It\u2019s gotten to a point where we just don't live the same life as everybody else. Manya Brachear Pashman: Has the work you\u2019ve done over the past two decades made a difference? For example, since the Second Intifada, there have been a number of conflicts between Israel and terrorist groups in Gaza. Do you see progress? Simone Rodan Benzaquen: We in Europe have felt like we've been doing a little bit of the work of Sisyphus over the past two decades, where we have moments of hope and things are getting better. And we say to ourselves, oh, maybe this is a wakeup call. And sort of, then we go back to, you know, before. And I hope that this this time around, given the level of violence, given the level of antisemitic hate crimes, given the number of sheer antisemitic attacks.\u00a0 When you actually take it down, you come to on average about 40 antisemitic acts a day. I mean, that's huge for a population that represents far less than 1% of the entire French population. I hope this will serve as a wakeup call. But there is the question of what does it mean, how do you translate it politically? How do you translate it into government action? I mean, Europe has come up with different plans, action plans against antisemitism, but it's not enough and more needs to be done. I think one of the things that we as Jewish communities were very wary about was the fact that\u00a0 over the past sort of two decades, there was sort of a lack of how can I say, solidarity from other French people. Again, we've had antisemitic hate crimes for the last 20 years, people have been murdered. But every single time, when you look at the demonstrations, at the marches after something horrible happened, you would mostly have a few hundred, or maybe a few thousand Jews in the streets.\u00a0 And so there was sort of a feeling that within the French Jewish community that they were a little bit abandoned by the rest of society. And so we know from our surveys, AJC does a survey every two years where we know that, for example, French people, and Germans as well, are convinced about the fact that antisemitism is not the problem of Jews alone, but that of the entire society.\u00a0 So both in Germany and in France, 73% of the population say that it is not the problem of Jews alone. But despite that number, it has never sort of translated into something concrete. So we would never have marches. We would never have like sort of big shows of solidarity with the Jewish community. And I think, since, if there's one good news, and there's not a lot of good news these days, if there's one good news is that last Sunday there were massive demonstrations across France, against antisemitism with basically the entire political class were present, with 20 government ministers who were present, with a prime minister who was present, with three former prime ministers who were present, two former presidents, plus a lot of people on the streets. We had over 180,000 people in the streets of France, basically expressing solidarity with the Jewish community and saying that they want to fight against antisemitism. So I think that was a sort of a very important sign of hope for many French Jews. \u2026. Manya Brachear Pashman: Now we go to the continent of Africa, where AJC Africa Director Wayne Sussman joins us from the South African city of Johannesburg to explain how the war that began on October 7 affects Israel\u2019s relations with African countries.\u00a0 Wayne Sussman: I would say the tensest of the relationships right now is between Israel and South Africa. The Ambassador of Israel to South Africa received a d\u00e9marche.\u00a0 So when the first two countries to recall their ambassadors were South Africa and Chad. When it comes to Chad, that was more unexpected than South Africa. Because relations were recently increasing between Chad and Israel. Sadly\u2013and one's got to remember that the largest Jewish community in Africa by a country mile is in South Africa. But sadly, the government of South Africa has had a very adversarial relationship with the State of Israel over the last few years. And this has manifested in the last few weeks. Manya Brachear Pashman: Because of this antagonistic relationship with Israel, has the South African Jewish community faced quite a bit of antisemitism? Wayne Sussman: Even though the current government of South Africa has had an adversarial relationship with the State of Israel, levels of antisemitism are extremely low\u2013far lower than Europe, far lower than Latin America, far lower than the United States of America, far lower than Canada, far lower than Australia.\u00a0 So we are working off a very low base here in South Africa. But over the last few weeks, antisemitic incidents have increased. For the time being, levels of violent incidents have been low. A turning point was on Sunday afternoon in Cape Town on the Sea Point Promenade, just to zone in on Sea Point, where the majority of Jews in Cape Town live. And the promenade is a beautiful public space, which all residents of the city use.\u00a0 And what we saw the day before was a pro-Palestinian demonstration through the streets of the City of Cape Town. It was a largely peaceful protest. There were pockets of the protests, which had hateful slogans and made concerning threats against the main Jewish Day School in Cape Town.\u00a0 And then the next day, a group of Christians at the Sea Point Promenade, which I referred to earlier, which is in the Jewish neighborhood of Sea Point, were going to have a prayer vigil for the State of Israel. They had a stage set up, microphones, etc. And a group of 200 to 300 pro-Palestinian, pro-Hamas supporters sympathizers came and disrupted it. And the police had to get involved and use water cannons. It's very rare for us to see sights like this in South Africa, particularly in Sea Point. Manya Brachear Pashman: So what I\u2019m hearing you say is the antagonism toward Israel doesn\u2019t normally translate into antagonism that targets the Jewish community there? Wayne Sussman: One of the worrying sides we see is our threats against, first of all, multinational corporations. I think these threats will not be impactful. But what is more concerning are privately owned Jewish businesses. And we have seen specific targets in this regard. Because of\u00a0 the CEOs of these businesses purporting to support and stand with Israel. But I think we need to see how successful these are going to be.\u00a0 But I think the community is incredibly united right now. They are standing strong. And it's vital because this is a very important Jewish community in South Africa. A rich history, this community has made a remarkable contribution to the fight against apartheid, to building this economy, to creating jobs in the field of medicine and law, to arts and culture, and even some in sport. Manya Brachear Pashman: There was a United Nations resolution calling for a truce. I believe 35 African states voted in favor of that resolution but Cameroon and Ethiopia abstained. Can you shed a little light on where other African countries stand? Wayne Sussman: I would say the overwhelming amount of countries have adopted a neutral position that might change when we come to the United Nations and a multinational forum on the African continent like the African Union. But countries like Kenya, who under the new president have stood firmly and strongly with Israel. Countries, like Zambia have shown a lot of empathy towards Israel. That's a version relationship. And then we look at countries in the west of Africa, Togo and Cameroon. They've historically had very strong ties with Israel, those ties remain. And then you have countries like the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda, those countries have stood firmly with Israel at this time. An interesting development. And again, this is a very fluid situation. But Indian Ocean islands like Mauritius, and Seychelles, where I was, I've been surprised at their even-handedness on this particular situation.\u00a0 Ethiopia is a fascinating country. It\u2019s a country which for many years had remarkable levels of economic growth, a very young population, one of the largest populations in Africa, also the center of the African Union, and also the hub of African air travel. And, of course, a country where many of Israel\u2019s citizens hail from and still maintain deep personal ties to. So I think that Ethiopia abstaining was very, very interesting in that regard. And that ties will be stronger between the two countries after this. Manya Brachear Pashman: I should note that Sudan and Morocco, two signatories of the Abraham Accords, did vote in favor of a truce. Do you see those ties weakened by all of this? Wayne Sussman: I think universally, it's going to be a challenging time for Israel. But I think once the dust settles, that you will see countries like Morocco return to embracing normalization. You'll see countries like Zambia, who are not part of the Abraham Accords, but are deepening ties, I think they will continue to do that. So I think the next few days and weeks will be very difficult. But again, back to what I was saying earlier, from a bilateral level, I think African countries are pragmatic.\u00a0 Those which were considering the Abraham Accords will see the benefit with regards to Israel, agritech Israel in fintech, Israel in rural health care, Israel in rural development. I think countries have seen a great benefit in deepening those ties. So it is going to be tested, certainly in places like the United Nations, certainly in forums like the African Union.\u00a0 What's very interesting, there was an interview in a Saudi Arabian newspaper recently with the president of Somalia. And he was very bullish, saying that if Israel and the Palestinians agreed to a two-state solution, that it would be right for Somalia to engage in peaceful relations with Israel.\u00a0 So even though we're in a very difficult and dark time, and it's unclear what's going to happen, we\u2019re seeing signs from Somalia, which is obviously in Africa, and also signs in Saudi Arabia, that even once the dust settles over here, that diplomatic doors will still remain open. \u2026. Manya Brachear Pashman: In July 1994, terrorists bombed the AMIA Jewish Community Center in Buenos Aires, killing 85 people and injuring more than 300 others. From that point on, the Argentine capital became known as the site of the worst and most fatal antisemitic attack since the Holocaust. That distinction changed on October 7 when terrorists breached the border between Israel and Gaza and murdered more than 1,200 people. As the Director of AJC\u2019s Belfer Institute for Latin American Affairs Dina Siegel Vann explains, it has not been an easy time for Jews on the South American continent or other Spanish-speaking regions.\u00a0 Dina Siegel Vann: Some of the countries that have really concerned us the most, are countries like Colombia, which in the past used to be the most steadfast ally of the United States and of Israel. But since the arrival of President Petro, who is a leftist ideologue, I would say, this has changed. And since October 7, we have seen really the country go in a totally different direction, which is really endangering the relationship not only with Israel, but with the United States.\u00a0 Colombia, President Petro has tweeted on October 8, he was already tweeting, where he was comparing Gaza to Auschwitz, where he was talking about international bankers, and he was talking about, the media, international media being on the side of those who commit genocide.\u00a0 So, you know, that has already made for a very rarefied environment, in terms of relations, as I said, both with the United States and what Israel. He also threatened through his foreign minister, the expulsion of the Israeli ambassador who was responding to his attacks, and now he has recalled his ambassador to Israel. Manya Brachear Pashman: Chile also has been unfriendly, but that\u2019s been the case for a while. It is home to the largest Palestinian diaspora outside the Middle East, and leaders of that community have expressed support for Hamas. But AJC will hold its annual strategic forum for Latin American and Iberian leaders in Santiago this month. Can you give us the lay of the land there?\u00a0 Dina Siegel Vann: So what has happened since is that President Boric, who, you know, who identifies with those positions of the Palestinian community has also had very hostile attitudes towards Israel. Number one, you know, he has not met with the Jewish community, he has not expressed his condolences, he hasn't expressed his condolences to Israel, and to the families of the victims. And he has also spoken, you know, mostly about what is going on in Gaza, and has characterized Israel's efforts to defend itself as genocidal as crimes against humanity, etc. And that also has created a very very vulnerable sense in the Jewish community in Chile that feels, you know, totally alone when it comes to this development. So I would say that Chile and Colombia have been the most egregious cases. Particularly because we're not talking about insignificant countries in the region, we're talking about Colombia, which is the third largest recipient of U.S. aid after Israel and Egypt. And we're talking about a country like Chile, who has always been or considers itself a paragon of human rights, not only in the region, but around the world. So their voices count, and that's why, you know, it concerns us a great deal. Manya Brachear Pashman: As I mentioned at the beginning of this conversation, until October 7, the worst antisemitic attack since the Holocaust had taken place in Argentina in 1994, carried out by Iran\u2019s terror proxy, Hezbollah. And just recently, Brazilian police detained a couple of Hezbollah operatives who were in the country with plans to attack Brazilian Jewish institutions, correct?\u00a0 Dina Siegel Vann: It underscores the really, really dangerous role that Iran plays in the region. And we know firsthand about it, because of course, the attacks in 1992 and 1994. But we know about it also, because of the tri-border area, where we know that Hezbollah and Hamas are very active, undertaking all kinds of money laundering activities. It's very important that we keep a focus on that. I think the U.S. is very, very keen on following very closely what's going on in that area, and in other areas in other areas of the region, including Venezuela, which has been the gateway to Iran in the region. Iran is very well positioned in that country and has ties to President Maduro. Started with President Chavez and it has continued with President Maduro.\u00a0 So we need to keep in focus, when we talk about, you know, potentially dangerous scenarios, not only from lead for Latin America, but for the United States for the whole hemisphere., this, you know, Iran is quite\u00a0 active. And is really, you know, thinking about how to create mischief, you know, whether in Brazil or elsewhere.We don't remember that, you know, that we have really a dangerous situation very close in our own neighborhood. Manya Brachear Pashman: You have told me that 30% of the hostages hail from Latin America: Brazil, Chile, Uruguay, Mexico, 15 from Argentina.\u00a0 Dina Siegel Vann: Yes. Well, I have to say that Argentina, for example, President Fernandez published in the New York Times a half a page with a letter an open letter demanding that the hostages be brought home and talking about their own hostages their own citizens. So yeah, absolutely. I mean, the hostages are traveling, there's some hostages from Latin American families that are traveling all around the region, meeting with members of Congress meeting with government officials and others and the media to raise more awareness about the issue and pressure the governments, their own governments to to speak up, you know, on on on, on behalf on to bring that these hostages home.\u00a0 Manya Brachear Pashman: Since recording this episode, many of those hostages with Latin American citizenship have been able to return home. Of course, there are still so many hostages\u2013 nearly 160. To push for their safe return, listeners can head to AJC.org/BringThemHome or follow the link in our show notes.\u00a0 Dina, take us back to Europe\u2013tell us about the situation in Spain.\u00a0 Dina Siegel Vann: Spain has been a mixed bag, because you have President Sanchez and Foreign Minister Alvarez has come out from the very beginning with very strong signs of support towards Israel, recognizing Hamas as a terrorist organization recognizes Israel's right to defend itself. But they they were in the process of creating a government and they need some of the more radical parties, independent parties, and, you know, some other parties like Soomad, who are very anti-Israel, they needed them to form coalition's and this parties were speaking, you know, in very vile terms regarding Israel, and really indulging on some antisemitic themes, and President Sanchez, didn't come out publicly as well as, you know, Foreign Minister Robotis to denounce them. But at the same time, they made clear that everybody understood that in foreign policy, what counts is the voice of the President and the voice of the foreign minister.\u00a0 They met with the Jewish community, they expressed their their their solidarity, they express their concern about antisemitism, they met with the families of the kidnapped. So they have really tried to, you know, to keep a very balanced and very difficult position, vis a vis, their current situation. They formed a government yesterday, the government was finally formed. And maybe at this point, they will be more, they'll have more leeway to come out to protest this type of discourse.\u00a0 But at the same time, you know, in Spain, you have seen some vandalism, you have seen some intimidation in schools against Jews and Israelis. So as I said, it's a mixed bag. And we are still monitoring this very carefully. Spain wants to be a leader, wants to be a convener when it comes to negotiating some sort of peace deal, they did it in the Madrid Conference a while back, they see their role, once again, as you know, as as a liaison, as a bridge between both worlds and therefore, you know, they always try to keep a very careful stance when it comes to both communities. \u00a0\u00a0  ", "duration_ms": 1497000, "explicit": false, "html_description": "<p>Following Hamas\u2019 October 7 massacre of Israelis Jews around the world have experienced a\u00a0 surge of antisemitism.

For today\u2019s episode, we checked in with some of those offices to learn what they&#39;re seeing and hearing on the ground since the October 7 Hamas terrorist attack on Israel. Today, we take you to Europe, Africa and Latin America. We start in Paris, where years of work to combat rising antisemitism has seen a serious setback.</p> <p>For more than two decades, since the Second Intifada, antisemitism has been on the rise on the European continent. In fact, it was that ripple effect that prompted AJC to ramp up its advocacy there. AJC Managing Director of Europe Simone Rodan Benzaquen joined us from Paris.</p> <p>Simone Rodan Benzaquen: What we have seen, I think, in Europe is more or less what we&#39;ve seen, everywhere, what can only be described as an explosion of antisemitism across the European continent, I would say, mostly in Western Europe, here in France in particular, but also in the United Kingdom, we have seen the same. In Germany, we have seen similar things going on in Sweden and Denmark. But of course, here in France, where antisemitism has existed for at least two decades, or at least this contemporary form of antisemitism, for the past two decades with high numbers of antisemitic hate crimes. The situation is very, very serious. We&#39;ve had basically three times the number of antisemitic hate crimes, since October 7 of what we had during the entire year, last year. \u00a0</p> <p>We have desecration of cemeteries, we have antisemitic tags. We have intimidation, we have spitting on people. It is as if the sheer horror, the violence that happened on October 7, unleashed an antisemitic passion, an antisemitic violence across the world. As if the horrible images that were filmed by the Hamas terrorists on October 7 sort of was a legitimization.</p> <p>Manya Brachear Pashman: So what does that mean for the Jewish community and daily life?</p> <p>Simone Rodan Benzaquen: We\u2019ve reached a point where people are hiding every single aspect of their Jewish identity. People are changing their names on their delivery apps, people are changing their names on their doorbells, if they believe that they sound Jewish. People are hiding every single aspect of their Jewish identity. On Uber apps, on taxi apps, myself, you know, I go on TV and do interviews quite a bit and so I give a different name to the taxi, and I give a different address a few blocks down the street is to be sure that you know, just in case, the taxi driver doesn&#39;t know where I actually live. So everybody takes precautions. It\u2019s gotten to a point where we just don&#39;t live the same life as everybody else.</p> <p>Manya Brachear Pashman: Has the work you\u2019ve done over the past two decades made a difference? For example, since the Second Intifada, there have been a number of conflicts between Israel and terrorist groups in Gaza. Do you see progress?</p> <p>Simone Rodan Benzaquen: We in Europe have felt like we&#39;ve been doing a little bit of the work of Sisyphus over the past two decades, where we have moments of hope and things are getting better. And we say to ourselves, oh, maybe this is a wakeup call. And sort of, then we go back to, you know, before. And I hope that this this time around, given the level of violence, given the level of antisemitic hate crimes, given the number of sheer antisemitic attacks.\u00a0</p> <p>When you actually take it down, you come to on average about 40 antisemitic acts a day. I mean, that&#39;s huge for a population that represents far less than 1% of the entire French population. I hope this will serve as a wakeup call. But there is the question of what does it mean, how do you translate it politically? How do you translate it into government action? I mean, Europe has come up with different plans, action plans against antisemitism, but it&#39;s not enough and more needs to be done.</p> <p>I think one of the things that we as Jewish communities were very wary about was the fact that\u00a0 over the past sort of two decades, there was sort of a lack of how can I say, solidarity from other French people. Again, we&#39;ve had antisemitic hate crimes for the last 20 years, people have been murdered. But every single time, when you look at the demonstrations, at the marches after something horrible happened, you would mostly have a few hundred, or maybe a few thousand Jews in the streets.\u00a0</p> <p>And so there was sort of a feeling that within the French Jewish community that they were a little bit abandoned by the rest of society. And so we know from our surveys, AJC does a survey every two years where we know that, for example, French people, and Germans as well, are convinced about the fact that antisemitism is not the problem of Jews alone, but that of the entire society.\u00a0</p> <p>So both in Germany and in France, 73% of the population say that it is not the problem of Jews alone. But despite that number, it has never sort of translated into something concrete. So we would never have marches. We would never have like sort of big shows of solidarity with the Jewish community. And I think, since, if there&#39;s one good news, and there&#39;s not a lot of good news these days, if there&#39;s one good news is that last Sunday there were massive demonstrations across France, against antisemitism with basically the entire political class were present, with 20 government ministers who were present, with a prime minister who was present, with three former prime ministers who were present, two former presidents, plus a lot of people on the streets. We had over 180,000 people in the streets of France, basically expressing solidarity with the Jewish community and saying that they want to fight against antisemitism. So I think that was a sort of a very important sign of hope for many French Jews.</p> <p>\u2026.</p> <p>Manya Brachear Pashman: Now we go to the continent of Africa, where AJC Africa Director Wayne Sussman joins us from the South African city of Johannesburg to explain how the war that began on October 7 affects Israel\u2019s relations with African countries.\u00a0</p> <p>Wayne Sussman: I would say the tensest of the relationships right now is between Israel and South Africa. The Ambassador of Israel to South Africa received a d\u00e9marche.\u00a0</p> <p>So when the first two countries to recall their ambassadors were South Africa and Chad. When it comes to Chad, that was more unexpected than South Africa. Because relations were recently increasing between Chad and Israel. Sadly\u2013and one&#39;s got to remember that the largest Jewish community in Africa by a country mile is in South Africa. But sadly, the government of South Africa has had a very adversarial relationship with the State of Israel over the last few years. And this has manifested in the last few weeks.</p> <p>Manya Brachear Pashman: Because of this antagonistic relationship with Israel, has the South African Jewish community faced quite a bit of antisemitism?</p> <p>Wayne Sussman: Even though the current government of South Africa has had an adversarial relationship with the State of Israel, levels of antisemitism are extremely low\u2013far lower than Europe, far lower than Latin America, far lower than the United States of America, far lower than Canada, far lower than Australia.\u00a0</p> <p>So we are working off a very low base here in South Africa. But over the last few weeks, antisemitic incidents have increased. For the time being, levels of violent incidents have been low. A turning point was on Sunday afternoon in Cape Town on the Sea Point Promenade, just to zone in on Sea Point, where the majority of Jews in Cape Town live. And the promenade is a beautiful public space, which all residents of the city use.\u00a0</p> <p>And what we saw the day before was a pro-Palestinian demonstration through the streets of the City of Cape Town. It was a largely peaceful protest. There were pockets of the protests, which had hateful slogans and made concerning threats against the main Jewish Day School in Cape Town.\u00a0</p> <p>And then the next day, a group of Christians at the Sea Point Promenade, which I referred to earlier, which is in the Jewish neighborhood of Sea Point, were going to have a prayer vigil for the State of Israel. They had a stage set up, microphones, etc. And a group of 200 to 300 pro-Palestinian, pro-Hamas supporters sympathizers came and disrupted it. And the police had to get involved and use water cannons. It&#39;s very rare for us to see sights like this in South Africa, particularly in Sea Point.</p> <p>Manya Brachear Pashman: So what I\u2019m hearing you say is the antagonism toward Israel doesn\u2019t normally translate into antagonism that targets the Jewish community there?</p> <p>Wayne Sussman: One of the worrying sides we see is our threats against, first of all, multinational corporations. I think these threats will not be impactful. But what is more concerning are privately owned Jewish businesses. And we have seen specific targets in this regard. Because of\u00a0 the CEOs of these businesses purporting to support and stand with Israel. But I think we need to see how successful these are going to be.\u00a0</p> <p>But I think the community is incredibly united right now. They are standing strong. And it&#39;s vital because this is a very important Jewish community in South Africa. A rich history, this community has made a remarkable contribution to the fight against apartheid, to building this economy, to creating jobs in the field of medicine and law, to arts and culture, and even some in sport.</p> <p>Manya Brachear Pashman: There was a United Nations resolution calling for a truce. I believe 35 African states voted in favor of that resolution but Cameroon and Ethiopia abstained. Can you shed a little light on where other African countries stand?</p> <p>Wayne Sussman: I would say the overwhelming amount of countries have adopted a neutral position that might change when we come to the United Nations and a multinational forum on the African continent like the African Union. But countries like Kenya, who under the new president have stood firmly and strongly with Israel. Countries, like Zambia have shown a lot of empathy towards Israel. That&#39;s a version relationship. And then we look at countries in the west of Africa, Togo and Cameroon. They&#39;ve historically had very strong ties with Israel, those ties remain. And then you have countries like the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda, those countries have stood firmly with Israel at this time.</p> <p>An interesting development. And again, this is a very fluid situation. But Indian Ocean islands like Mauritius, and Seychelles, where I was, I&#39;ve been surprised at their even-handedness on this particular situation.\u00a0</p> <p>Ethiopia is a fascinating country. It\u2019s a country which for many years had remarkable levels of economic growth, a very young population, one of the largest populations in Africa, also the center of the African Union, and also the hub of African air travel. And, of course, a country where many of Israel\u2019s citizens hail from and still maintain deep personal ties to. So I think that Ethiopia abstaining was very, very interesting in that regard. And that ties will be stronger between the two countries after this.</p> <p>Manya Brachear Pashman: I should note that Sudan and Morocco, two signatories of the Abraham Accords, did vote in favor of a truce. Do you see those ties weakened by all of this?</p> <p>Wayne Sussman: I think universally, it&#39;s going to be a challenging time for Israel. But I think once the dust settles, that you will see countries like Morocco return to embracing normalization. You&#39;ll see countries like Zambia, who are not part of the Abraham Accords, but are deepening ties, I think they will continue to do that. So I think the next few days and weeks will be very difficult. But again, back to what I was saying earlier, from a bilateral level, I think African countries are pragmatic.\u00a0</p> <p>Those which were considering the Abraham Accords will see the benefit with regards to Israel, agritech Israel in fintech, Israel in rural health care, Israel in rural development. I think countries have seen a great benefit in deepening those ties. So it is going to be tested, certainly in places like the United Nations, certainly in forums like the African Union.\u00a0</p> <p>What&#39;s very interesting, there was an interview in a Saudi Arabian newspaper recently with the president of Somalia. And he was very bullish, saying that if Israel and the Palestinians agreed to a two-state solution, that it would be right for Somalia to engage in peaceful relations with Israel.\u00a0</p> <p>So even though we&#39;re in a very difficult and dark time, and it&#39;s unclear what&#39;s going to happen, we\u2019re seeing signs from Somalia, which is obviously in Africa, and also signs in Saudi Arabia, that even once the dust settles over here, that diplomatic doors will still remain open.</p> <p>\u2026.</p> <p>Manya Brachear Pashman: In July 1994, terrorists bombed the AMIA Jewish Community Center in Buenos Aires, killing 85 people and injuring more than 300 others. From that point on, the Argentine capital became known as the site of the worst and most fatal antisemitic attack since the Holocaust. That distinction changed on October 7 when terrorists breached the border between Israel and Gaza and murdered more than 1,200 people. As the Director of AJC\u2019s Belfer Institute for Latin American Affairs Dina Siegel Vann explains, it has not been an easy time for Jews on the South American continent or other Spanish-speaking regions.\u00a0</p> <p>Dina Siegel Vann: Some of the countries that have really concerned us the most, are countries like Colombia, which in the past used to be the most steadfast ally of the United States and of Israel. But since the arrival of President Petro, who is a leftist ideologue, I would say, this has changed. And since October 7, we have seen really the country go in a totally different direction, which is really endangering the relationship not only with Israel, but with the United States.\u00a0</p> <p>Colombia, President Petro has tweeted on October 8, he was already tweeting, where he was comparing Gaza to Auschwitz, where he was talking about international bankers, and he was talking about, the media, international media being on the side of those who commit genocide.\u00a0</p> <p>So, you know, that has already made for a very rarefied environment, in terms of relations, as I said, both with the United States and what Israel. He also threatened through his foreign minister, the expulsion of the Israeli ambassador who was responding to his attacks, and now he has recalled his ambassador to Israel.</p> <p>Manya Brachear Pashman: Chile also has been unfriendly, but that\u2019s been the case for a while. It is home to the largest Palestinian diaspora outside the Middle East, and leaders of that community have expressed support for Hamas. But AJC will hold its annual strategic forum for Latin American and Iberian leaders in Santiago this month. Can you give us the lay of the land there?\u00a0</p> <p>Dina Siegel Vann: So what has happened since is that President Boric, who, you know, who identifies with those positions of the Palestinian community has also had very hostile attitudes towards Israel. Number one, you know, he has not met with the Jewish community, he has not expressed his condolences, he hasn&#39;t expressed his condolences to Israel, and to the families of the victims. And he has also spoken, you know, mostly about what is going on in Gaza, and has characterized Israel&#39;s efforts to defend itself as genocidal as crimes against humanity, etc.</p> <p>And that also has created a very very vulnerable sense in the Jewish community in Chile that feels, you know, totally alone when it comes to this development. So I would say that Chile and Colombia have been the most egregious cases. Particularly because we&#39;re not talking about insignificant countries in the region, we&#39;re talking about Colombia, which is the third largest recipient of U.S. aid after Israel and Egypt. And we&#39;re talking about a country like Chile, who has always been or considers itself a paragon of human rights, not only in the region, but around the world. So their voices count, and that&#39;s why, you know, it concerns us a great deal.</p> <p>Manya Brachear Pashman: As I mentioned at the beginning of this conversation, until October 7, the worst antisemitic attack since the Holocaust had taken place in Argentina in 1994, carried out by Iran\u2019s terror proxy, Hezbollah. And just recently, Brazilian police detained a couple of Hezbollah operatives who were in the country with plans to attack Brazilian Jewish institutions, correct?\u00a0</p> <p>Dina Siegel Vann: It underscores the really, really dangerous role that Iran plays in the region. And we know firsthand about it, because of course, the attacks in 1992 and 1994. But we know about it also, because of the tri-border area, where we know that Hezbollah and Hamas are very active, undertaking all kinds of money laundering activities.</p> <p>It&#39;s very important that we keep a focus on that. I think the U.S. is very, very keen on following very closely what&#39;s going on in that area, and in other areas in other areas of the region, including Venezuela, which has been the gateway to Iran in the region. Iran is very well positioned in that country and has ties to President Maduro. Started with President Chavez and it has continued with President Maduro.\u00a0</p> <p>So we need to keep in focus, when we talk about, you know, potentially dangerous scenarios, not only from lead for Latin America, but for the United States for the whole hemisphere., this, you know, Iran is quite\u00a0 active. And is really, you know, thinking about how to create mischief, you know, whether in Brazil or elsewhere.We don&#39;t remember that, you know, that we have really a dangerous situation very close in our own neighborhood.</p> <p>Manya Brachear Pashman: You have told me that 30% of the hostages hail from Latin America: Brazil, Chile, Uruguay, Mexico, 15 from Argentina.\u00a0</p> <p>Dina Siegel Vann: Yes. Well, I have to say that Argentina, for example, President Fernandez published in the New York Times a half a page with a letter an open letter demanding that the hostages be brought home and talking about their own hostages their own citizens. So yeah, absolutely. I mean, the hostages are traveling, there&#39;s some hostages from Latin American families that are traveling all around the region, meeting with members of Congress meeting with government officials and others and the media to raise more awareness about the issue and pressure the governments, their own governments to to speak up, you know, on on on, on behalf on to bring that these hostages home.\u00a0</p> <p>Manya Brachear Pashman: Since recording this episode, many of those hostages with Latin American citizenship have been able to return home. Of course, there are still so many hostages\u2013 nearly 160. To push for their safe return, listeners can head to AJC.org/BringThemHome or follow the link in our show notes.\u00a0</p> <p>Dina, take us back to Europe\u2013tell us about the situation in Spain.\u00a0</p> <p>Dina Siegel Vann: Spain has been a mixed bag, because you have President Sanchez and Foreign Minister Alvarez has come out from the very beginning with very strong signs of support towards Israel, recognizing Hamas as a terrorist organization recognizes Israel&#39;s right to defend itself. But they they were in the process of creating a government and they need some of the more radical parties, independent parties, and, you know, some other parties like Soomad, who are very anti-Israel, they needed them to form coalition&#39;s and this parties were speaking, you know, in very vile terms regarding Israel, and really indulging on some antisemitic themes, and President Sanchez, didn&#39;t come out publicly as well as, you know, Foreign Minister Robotis to denounce them. But at the same time, they made clear that everybody understood that in foreign policy, what counts is the voice of the President and the voice of the foreign minister.\u00a0</p> <p>They met with the Jewish community, they expressed their their their solidarity, they express their concern about antisemitism, they met with the families of the kidnapped. So they have really tried to, you know, to keep a very balanced and very difficult position, vis a vis, their current situation. They formed a government yesterday, the government was finally formed. And maybe at this point, they will be more, they&#39;ll have more leeway to come out to protest this type of discourse.\u00a0</p> <p>But at the same time, you know, in Spain, you have seen some vandalism, you have seen some intimidation in schools against Jews and Israelis. So as I said, it&#39;s a mixed bag. And we are still monitoring this very carefully. Spain wants to be a leader, wants to be a convener when it comes to negotiating some sort of peace deal, they did it in the Madrid Conference a while back, they see their role, once again, as you know, as as a liaison, as a bridge between both worlds and therefore, you know, they always try to keep a very careful stance when it comes to both communities.</p> <p>\u00a0\u00a0</p> <p> </p>", "id": "6800Ngfm6h6ExlJCNlxEDl", "is_externally_hosted": false, "is_playable": true, "language": "en", "languages": ["en"], "name": "Global Antisemitism Report Part 1: What It\u2019s Like to Be Jewish in Europe, Latin America, and South Africa Right Now", "release_date": "2023-12-04", "release_date_precision": "day", "show": {"description": "People of the Pod is an award-winning weekly podcast analyzing global affairs through a Jewish lens, brought to you by American Jewish Committee.

He is also an avid public educator, having written five bestselling books, delivered several top-ranking TED Talks and is the host of two psychology podcasts. We discuss how to overcome procrastination, how to increase intrinsic motivation (even for dreaded tasks), identify blind spots and rethink our assumptions, and how we can build a persistent growth mindset. We also explain tools to improve creativity and discuss the surprising relationship between creativity and procrastination. We then explore how to effectively solicit useful feedback and grow from constructive criticism and how you can improve your level of focus and attention using science-supported methods. We also discuss mental tools to get out of negative thought spirals, how to nurture potential in yourself or others, and the dark side of perfectionism. The discussion delivers more than a dozen science-supported protocols that are readily applicable to anyone seeking to live a more productive, fulfilling, and creative life.

We also discuss existing and emerging tools for measuring and changing how our nervous system works. Andrew Huberman, Ph.D., is a neuroscientist and tenured professor in the department of neurobiology, and by courtesy, psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford School of Medicine. He has made numerous significant contributions to the fields of brain development, brain function and neural plasticity, which is the ability of our nervous system to rewire and learn new behaviors, skills and cognitive functioning.\u00a0 Huberman\u00a0is a McKnight Foundation and Pew Foundation Fellow and was awarded the Cogan Award, given to the scientist making the most significant discoveries in the study of vision, in 2017. His lab\u2019s most recent work focuses on the influence of vision and respiration on human performance and brain states such as fear and courage. He also works on neural regeneration and directs a clinical trial to promote visual restoration in diseases that cause blindness.\u00a0Huberman is also actively involved in developing tools now in use by the elite military in the U.S. and Canada, athletes, and technology industries to optimize performance in high stress environments, enhance neural plasticity, mitigate stress and optimize sleep.\u00a0\u00a0 Work from the\u00a0Huberman\u00a0Laboratory at Stanford School of Medicine has been published in top journals including Nature, Science and Cell and has been featured in TIME, BBC, Scientific American, Discover and other top media outlets.\u00a0 In 2021, Dr. Huberman launched the Huberman Lab podcast.
