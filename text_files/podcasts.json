[{"description": "Nietzsche's maxim, \"What doesn't kill you makes you stronger,\" isn't just a sound philosophical principle. It's also a certifiable physiological phenomenon; toxins and stressors that could be deadly in large doses, actually improve health and resilience in smaller, intermittent ones. The ironic thing, my guest points out, is that it's the fact that we're not getting enough of this sublethal stress these days that's really doing us in.Paul Taylor is a former British Royal Navy Aircrew Officer, an exercise physiologist, nutritionist, and neuroscientist, and the author of Death by Comfort: How Modern Life is Killing Us and What We Can Do About It. Today on the show, Paul discusses the science of hormesis, how small doses of intermittent stress can make us more resistant to chronic stress, and why you need to embrace what Paul calls \"discomfort harvesting.\" We talk about some now-familiar topics like fasting and cold and heat exposure with fresh inspiration as to how important they are to practice and how to do them effectively. We discuss how hot a sauna needs to be to get the benefits of heat exposure, Paul's suggestion for how to make an ice bath on the cheap, what may be the single best type of food to eat to improve your gut's microbiome, a form of fasting that's got anti-cancer benefits but is so accessible it won't even feel like fasting, what supplement to take to mitigate the effects of a bad night's sleep, and much more. We end our conversation with how to use what Paul calls a \"ritual board\" to stick with your healthy habits and resist the \"soft underbelly\" of modern life.Resources Related to the PodcastAoMPodcast #708: Overcome the Comfort CrisisAoM article/video on the benefits\u00a0of cold showersAoM Podcast #801: The Cold Water Swim CureAoM Podcast #603: The Physical Keys to Human ResilienceAoM Article: How Saunas Can Help Save Your Body, Mind, and SpiritAoM Article: How to Sauna \u2014 All the FAQsAoM Podcast #585: Inflammation, Saunas, and the New Science of DepressionAoM Podcast #862: Heal the Body With Extended FastingPodcast #328: The Pros and Cons of Intermittent FastingAoM Podcast #581: The Tiny Habits That Change EverythingAoM Podcast #425: Action Over FeelingsThe NOVA Food Classification\u00a0SystemStanford study\u00a0on the effect\u00a0of fiber\u00a0and fermented food on the microbiomeResearch on\u00a0creatine as a neurotransmitter\u00a0and\u00a0creatine's effect on brain health\u00a0(including impact when sleep deprived)Connect With\u00a0PaulTaylorPaul's websitePaul\u00a0on IGPaul\u00a0on LinkedInPaul's podcastPaul's mental fitness course\u00a0for coaches and health professionals", "duration_ms": 3386592, "explicit": false, "id": "1TduDFYgD2yOV2jcF0P8hh", "is_playable": true, "name": "How to Avoid Death by Comfort", "release_date": "2023-11-06", "release_date_precision": "day", "show": {"description": "The Art of Manliness Podcast aims to deepen and improve every area of a man's life, from fitness and philosophy, to relationships and productivity.

Robert shares with us the recent findings of The Grant Study, which is the longest scientific study of happiness ever conducted. It\u2019s been ongoing for more than 80 years now, and has had high profile participants like US President John F. Kennedy. Robert and I get into the details of how they continue to conduct research and how to make sense of both the new and old data. Sure enough, what the study has found consistent is the power of connection.

That's because there isn't just one kind of failure, but three.Here to unpack what those three types are is Amy Edmondson, a professor of leadership at the Harvard Business School and the author of The Right Kind of Wrong: The Science of Failing Well. Today on the show, Amy shares which type of failure is most productive, which types are less fruitful, and how to best use the former, prevent the latter, and learn from failure of every kind. We also talk about how to organize potential failures into a matrix that will help you best approach them.

These tools represent key takeaways from several recently published research studies, as well as from former Huberman Lab guests Lisa Feldman Barrett, Ph.D., an expert in the science of emotions, and Paul Conti, M.D., a psychiatrist with vast clinical expertise in helping people overcome mental health challenges. I explain the first principles of self-care, which include the \u201cBig 6\u201d core pillars for mood and mental health. Those ensure our physiology is primed for our overall feelings of well-being. Then, I explain science-based tools to directly increase confidence, build a stronger concept of self, better understand our unconscious mind, manage stress and improve our emotional tone and processing. I also explain ways to better process negative emotions and traumas.

He describes how the foundation of mental health is an understanding of one\u2019s own mind and the specific questions to ask in order to explore the conscious and unconscious parts of ourselves. He describes how this process can be done either on our own, through journaling, meditation and structured thought, or in therapy with the help of a licensed professional. He also explains how unprocessed trauma can short-circuit the process and how to prevent that, and the role of friendships and other relational support systems in the journey of self-exploration for mental health. People of all ages and those with and without self-introspection and therapy experience ought to benefit from the information in this episode.

Eating too much, drinking too much, buying too much, looking at your phone too much. Why do we have such a propensity for overdoing it?My guest says it's all thanks to a \"scarcity loop\" that we're hardwired to follow. Once you understand how this loop works, you can start taking action to resist the compulsive cravings that sabotage your life.Michael Easter is the author of Scarcity Brain: Fix Your Craving Mindset and Rewire Your Habits to Thrive with Enough. Today on the show, Michael unpacks the three parts of the scarcity loop, and how they've been amplified in the modern day. We talk about the slot machine lab that corporations use to hack your brain, why your main problem may be that you're understimulated rather than overstimulated, why addiction may be better thought of as a symptom rather than a disease, how the quantification and gamification of life can negatively impact your experience of it, and how ultimately, the fix for resisting your bad habits is having something better to do than chase the cheap, unsatisfying hits of pleasure our culture so readily offers.Resources Related to the PodcastMichael's previous appearance on the AoM podcast: Episode #708 \u2014 Overcome the Comfort CrisisAoM Article: Via Negativa \u2014 Adding to Your Life By SubtractingResearch of Thomas ZentallResearch of C.

As an example of this, imagine an infant lying in its cradle, and the window is open, and into the room comes something, marvelous, mysterious, glittering, shedding light of many colors, movement, sound, a transformative hierophany of integrated perception and the child is enthralled and then the mother comes into the room and she says to the child, \u201cthat\u2019s a bird, baby, that\u2019s a bird,\u201d instantly the complex wave of the angel peacock iridescent trans-formative mystery is collapsed, into the word. All mystery is gone, the child learns this is a bird, this is a bird, and by the time we\u2019re five or six years old all the mystery of reality has been carefully tiled over with words. This is a bird, this is a house, this is the sky, and we seal ourselves in within a linguistic shell of dis-empowered perception.\"\u00a0Listen to my in-depth psychedelic podcast: The James Xander Trip \ud83c\udfa7 The Mission - Let's get 1 billion humans to take shrooms on the same day.\u00a0 Connect with James Xander\u00a0\u2022 Newsletter\u2022 YouTube\u2022 Instagram\u2022 Twitter\u2022 PatreonFeedback or questions?

He explains a roadmap of the conscious and unconscious mind that can allow anyone to navigate conflicts better and set healthy boundaries in relationships. We also discuss common features of unhealthy relationships and clinically supported tools for dealing with relationship insecurity, excessive anxiety, past traumas, manipulation and abuse. Dr. Conti explains how, in healthy relationships, there emerges a dynamic of the mutually generative \u201cus\u201d and how to continually improve that dynamic.

Is the solution getting a fitness tracker, developing more discipline, or buying a piece of cardio equipment for your basement?My guest would say none of the above, and would have you think about kids playing at recess instead.Darryl Edwards is the founder of the Primal Play Method. Today on the show, we discuss the epidemic of sedentariness which besets both adults and children and why technology and willpower isn\u2019t the cure for it. Darryl then explains why a better solution to getting more movement and physical activity in our lives is rediscovering the intrinsically motivating pleasure of play. He offers suggestions on how to do that, including compiling a play history for your life, embracing \u201cprimal movements\u201d that will get you moving like an animal and a child, and getting over the fear of looking goofy while doing so. We discuss the joys and health benefits of exploring your capabilities and environment and how to incorporate more movement into your busy adult life by making even regular activities more playful.Resources Related to the PodcastDarryl\u2019s books:Animal Moves: How to Move Like an Animal to Get You Leaner, Fitter, Stronger and Healthier for LifeMy First Animal Moves: A Children\u2019s Book to Encourage Kids and Their Parents to Move More, Sit Less and Decrease Screen TimeAoM Article: Get Fit Like a Wild Man \u2014 A Primer on MovNatAoM Article: The 10 Physical Skills Every Man Should MasterAoM Article: The Importance of Having a Physical IdentityAoM Article: 30 Days to a Better Man Day 24 \u2014 Play!AoM Podcast #508: Break Out of Your Cage and Stop Being a Human Zoo AnimalAoM Podcast #245: The Workout the World ForgotAoM Podcast #749: Let the Children Play!Connect With Darryl EdwardsPrimal Play websiteDarryl on FBDarryl on IG", "duration_ms": 2981720, "explicit": false, "id": "0E7R7LHaux0sBoTZUOGoaC", "is_playable": true, "name": "For a Better Work Out, Think Like a Kid", "release_date": "2023-09-20", "release_date_precision": "day", "show": {"description": "The Art of Manliness Podcast aims to deepen and improve every area of a man's life, from fitness and philosophy, to relationships and productivity.

I explain the data showing how music can increase motivation for cognitive or physical work, what specific music has been shown to enhance cognitive performance, and whether silence or music is more effective in enhancing focus while studying. I also discuss how specific musical pieces can rapidly reduce anxiety, as well as certain prescription medications. I explain how listening to certain types of music can improve various health metrics (e.g., heart rate). Finally, I discuss how music helps to enhance neuroplasticity (rewiring of brain connections), thereby improving learning and memory. Whether you sing, play an instrument or enjoy listening to music, this episode provides numerous science-informed tools for using music to enhance productivity, mood, emotional states, and overall enjoyment of life.

When you choose a path towards a goal, it's absolutely critical to optimize for the cost of learning. Often, with software, it is easier to learn by a series of smaller steps, even if they start out as random, rather than take on the major risk of a large step possibly going the wrong direction. This isn't always true; sometimes, the cost of learning is *greater* with small steps. Determining which is true in your situation can make or break your plans.## \ud83d\udcee Ask a QuestionIf you enjoyed this episode and would like me to discuss a question that you have on the show, drop it over at: developertea.com.## \ud83d\udcee Join the [Discord](https://developertea.com/discord%5D(https://developertea.com/discord))If you want to be a part of a supportive community of engineers (non-engineers welcome!) working to improve their lives and careers, join us on the Developer Tea Discord community by visiting [https://developertea.com/discord](https://developertea.com/discord) today!## \ud83e\udde1 Leave a ReviewIf you're enjoying the show and want to support the content head over to iTunes and [leave a review](https://ratethispodcast.com/devtea)!

We discuss the bidirectional connection between the mind and body and how our thoughts and mental practices (e.g., meditation and breathwork) impact our health. We also discuss the link between inflammation and depression. We also discuss Dr. Linden\u2019s terminal illness diagnosis, his mindset during chemotherapy and what his diagnosis has taught him about the mind, gratitude, time perception and life.

At the same time, the idea that marijuana is a safe drug has steadily increased.But is this an accurate perception?Recent research by my guest, Dr. Ryan Sultan, a professor of clinical psychiatry at Columbia University, casts some doubt on a universally affirmative answer to that question, and he says we need to be having a more objective, balanced, and nuanced conversation around cannabis than we currently are. We have exactly that kind of conversation today on the show. We dig into the fact that young adulta are the group most vulnerable to the potentially negative effects of cannabis and how marijuana use in adolescence is linked to both mental illness and cognitive deficits. Dr. Sultan unpacks how cannabis impacts the developing brain and may lead to schizophrenia, especially in males. We also talk about whether if you used marijuana as a young adult and then stopped, your brain can still recover, and a cannabis-related health concern for all ages that doesn\u2019t concern the brain.

US bureau chief Jacob Magid and News editor Luke Tress join host Jessica Steinberg for today's podcast. Magid discusses Washington equating two weekend attacks, one in which a Palestinian shot and killed a Tel Aviv patrolman and another in which a Palestinian was shot and killed by a Jewish settler. Tress looks at the incident in Memphis, Tennessee, during which a man unsuccessfully fired a handgun at a Jewish school, and was later discovered to be Jewish, and a former student at the school who had suffered a familial trauma years earlier. Magid looks at some of the provocative comments made by the outgoing EU ambassador to the Palestinians, Sven K\u00fchn von Burgsdorff, as he left his post and headed toward retirement. Tress talks about the recent incident with entertainer Jamie Foxx, who made antisemitic statement on social media, and later apologized.

What they don't spend\u00a0enough time working on, are the mental and emotional habits that can sabotage\u00a0their efforts, regardless of the diet plan they adopt.That's why my guest today, despite being a biochemist, has made\u00a0mindset\u00a0the foundation of his approach to losing weight.

We then talk about why Trevor focuses on bridging the gap between knowledge and action, and the erroneous\u00a0assumptions people make that keep\u00a0them from following through on their intentions. From there we turn to the phases TKN takes its clients through, which begins with getting what Trevor calls \"food clarity.\" We discuss how simply tracking what you eat can get you to naturally change your diet because of\u00a0something called \"the Hawthorne effect,\" and can almost be all you need to do to start losing weight. We then get into how to deal with your hunger when you're cutting calories, and why it's crucial to be decisive about it. We also discuss how you can eventually eat more once you work on eating less, how to manage the expectation of consistent\u00a0weight loss, and why you really need to weigh yourself every week.Resources Related to the PodcastAoM Podcast #708: Overcoming the Comfort Crisis\u00a0AoM Podcast #715: What's the Most Sustainable Diet?AoM Podcast #475: How to Lose Weight, and Keep It Off Forever\u00a0AoM article on how to track your food intakeAoM Article: 6 Ways to Measure Your Body FatThe Hawthorne effectAoM series on willpowerConnect With Dr. Trevor KasheyTrevor Kashey Nutrition: TKNTrevor on InstagramThe Best Nutrition Group EVER on FB", "duration_ms": 2867069, "explicit": false, "id": "77Ug481bKVM50XyjaMCOUA", "is_playable": true, "name": "The Psychology of Effective Weight Loss", "release_date": "2023-08-07", "release_date_precision": "day", "show": {"description": "The Art of Manliness Podcast aims to deepen and improve every area of a man's life, from fitness and philosophy, to relationships and productivity.

And it\u2019s true that no test can ever entirely peg the complexities of personality, and they shouldn\u2019t be applied with too much rigidity. But what these tests are useful for is serving as a prompt for reflecting on the particular ways you think, feel, and act, and, perhaps even more importantly, getting you to think about the fact that other people can see and approach the world in ways that are fundamentally different from your own.I haven\u2019t found a personality test that better serves as this kind of tool than what\u2019s called the \u201cPeople Code\u201d or the \u201cColor Code,\u201d which categorizes people into four colors: Reds, Blues, Whites, and Yellows. I\u2019ve found it uncanningly insightful in helping me understand myself and others better, and it\u2019s become a regular topic of conversation amongst my family and friends.Today I talk to the creator of the Color Code Personality Profile, psychologist Dr. Taylor Hartman. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the four color types, how to interact with each color to bring out their best traits, and how the colors combine in relationships.

Yet as we all know, in-between self often fails to follow through on what present self resolves, leaving future self pretty bummed out.The solution to this dilemma, my guest says, is for your present self to become much better friends with your future self.His name is Hal Hershfield, and he's a professor of marketing, behavioral decision making, and psychology, and the author of Your Future Self: How to Make Tomorrow Better Today. Hal and I spend the first part of our conversation taking a really interesting philosophical dive into what the self even is. We talk about why our future self can feel like a stranger, why it's hard to know what he'll be like, and what this dilemma has to do with becoming a vampire. We then discuss how building a stronger connection with your future self makes your present self more willing to help him, and how you can become closer to your future self by engaging in mental time traveling. Hal shares a couple techniques that can facilitate this mental time travel, three mistakes people make in taking this cognitive trip, and how to start making tomorrow better today.Resources Related to the Podcast\"The Self Is Moral\" by Nina StrohmingerTransformative Experience by L.

We discuss the brain\u2019s several reward systems involving dopamine and serotonin and how these motivate us to seek out specific behaviors and substances. We discuss how these reward systems are modified based on context and our memories, and how they can be hijacked toward maladaptive drug seeking in addiction.
