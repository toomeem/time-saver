user: what is a semaphore
bot: A semaphore is a synchronization object that controls access to a shared resource in a concurrent system. It allows multiple threads or processes to access a shared resource with mutual exclusion, meaning that only one thread or process can access the resource at a time. Semaphores can be used to prevent race conditions and ensure that critical sections of code are executed in a controlled manner. They maintain a count that can be incremented or decremented by threads or processes to control access to the shared resource.
